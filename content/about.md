My name is Rob Best. I live in the Peak District and work remotely as a Site

I enjoy solving problems and building infrastructure platforms with a software
engineering approach.

- [ssl_exporter](https://github.com/ribbybibby/ssl_exporter)
- [s3_exporter](https://github.com/ribbybibby/s3_exporter)
- [vault-kube-cloud-credentials](https://github.com/utilitywarehouse/vault-kube-cloud-credentials)
- [kube-applier](https://github.com/utilitywarehouse/kube-applier)
- [vault-manifests](https://github.com/utilitywarehouse/vault-manifests)

And some languages and technologies I work with regularly:
